## Standard provider binary for convention-only packages (Tier 2b).
##
## The Reprobuild engine routes any package whose declaration omits a
## ``build:`` block to this binary instead of compiling a per-project
## ``reprobuild.nim``. The binary walks the package's source tree
## following the ecosystem's conventional layout and emits the build
## graph directly.
##
## Per Provider-Compile-Tiering.md §"2b — repro-standard-provider" and
## Language-Conventions/README.md.
##
## **M1 framework.** Manifest requests advertise a single canonical
## entry point — ``StandardProviderRootEntryPointId`` — from the shared
## ``repro_standard_provider_protocol`` library (the manifest's shape
## doesn't depend on conventions — see
## Standard-Provider-Implementation.milestones.org §M1). Graph requests
## dispatch through ``defaultConventionRegistry``; on the first
## ``recognize`` hit the convention's ``emitFragment`` produces the
## fragment, otherwise we exit non-zero with a "no convention matched"
## diagnostic that names the project root and the package's ``uses:``
## hint (parsed heuristically — see project_intro.nim). Per-language
## convention plugins land in M3+.
