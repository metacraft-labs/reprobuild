## Deep-hash invalidation engine — the M1 deliverable of the
## Trace-Based-Incremental-Testing prototype campaign.
##
## Given a test's executed functions (discovered from a CodeTracer trace by
## `trace_reader`) and the *current* source tree, this module decides whether
## the test can be skipped ("skipped (unchanged)") or must be re-run. The
## algorithm follows `codetracer-specs/Planned-Features/`
## `Nim-Parallel-Test-Framework.md`:
##
## * §16.7.1 — *shallow hash*: a per-function hash of the function's body text.
## * §16.7.3 — *deep hash*: hash of the sorted-by-name concatenation of the
##   shallow hashes of the test's executed functions.
## * §16.7.4 — *workflow*: between runs we compare the *cached* dependency set
##   against the *current* source. We only re-trace and `record` when the test
##   is actually re-run.
##
## # Source extraction (language-agnostic; M3)
##
## Per-function source extraction is delegated to a `FunctionBodyExtractor`
## selected purely by file extension (see `extractors.nim`). The engine itself
## contains NO per-language logic: it asks `extractors.extractFunctionBody` for
## the body given the source file path, the source lines, and the 1-based
## `defLine`. Ruby (`.rb`) and Python (`.py`) use an indentation heuristic;
## JavaScript (`.js`) uses brace matching. An unknown extension yields an
## `Err`, which the engine maps to the reserved `"missing"` shallow hash so the
## test fail-safes to a re-run (never a silent wrong hash). The exact boundary
## rule matters only for stability, not correctness of the skip/re-run
## decision: as long as the same physical lines are captured for an unchanged
## function and different lines/text for a changed one, the engine is correct.
##
## # Normalization (documented)
##
## Before hashing, `shallowHash` normalizes the body text by:
##   * splitting into lines on `\n` (a trailing `\r` per line is stripped, so
##     CRLF and LF sources hash identically),
##   * stripping *trailing* whitespace from each line (trailing spaces/tabs are
##     not significant), and
##   * re-joining with `\n` and stripping a trailing newline.
##
## Leading whitespace (indentation) IS significant — it is part of the body in
## indentation-structured languages. Comments and blank lines inside the body
## ARE significant (this is the conservative choice: a comment edit triggers a
## re-run rather than risking a false skip). A whitespace/comment-insensitive
## AST mode is deferred to the tree-sitter milestone (M3+).
##
## # Missing functions
##
## If a function named in the cached dependency set no longer exists at its
## recorded `defLine` (the file is shorter than `defLine`, or the extractor
## cannot read a body there), or its source file's extension has no registered
## extractor, the body extraction returns an `Err`. The engine maps that to the
## reserved `"missing"` shallow hash. The deep hash therefore changes versus the
## recorded one, so `decide` returns `idRerunChanged` with the missing function
## listed — a removed/unreadable dependency is treated as changed and is never
## silently skipped (see `removed_executed_function_reruns`).

  ##
  ## A missing/unreadable binary, a function absent from the binary's symbol
  ## table, or any native-hash tooling error makes `shallowHashNative` return an
  ## `Err`; we map that to the reserved `"missing"` sentinel (via `shallowHash("")`)

  ## a future run that re-introduces the same id with different behaviour.
  ##
  ## This handles the *removed-test* case specifically. The complementary
  ## *removed-function within a still-present test* case needs no pruning: M1
  ## already treats a dependency that no longer exists in source as the
  ## reserved `"missing"` shallow hash, so such a test re-runs (never a silent
  ## skip) and is re-recorded with the current dependency set on that run.
  ##
  ## Pruning is idempotent: a test absent from BOTH the cache and `liveTestIds`
  ## is simply ignored, and an entry already pruned stays pruned. After this
  ## returns, a subsequent `decide` for a pruned test id yields `idRunFresh`
  ## (no entry ⇒ run-and-record), exactly as for a never-seen test.
  ##
  ## The on-disk cache is rewritten via `saveCache`. A persistence failure does
  ## NOT raise: the in-memory cache is still pruned, and the failure surfaces on
  ## the next explicit `saveCache` the caller performs. (Callers that need the
