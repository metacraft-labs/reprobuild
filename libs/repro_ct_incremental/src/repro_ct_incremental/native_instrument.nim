## Native call trace via compile-time instrumentation — the M14/M15 deliverable
## of the Trace-Based-Incremental-Testing campaign (Phase 4).
##
## This module is the native runtime dependency-discovery source for hosts that
## have NO Intel PT / RR / MCR emulator (notably arm64-macOS). The executed-
## function SET a native test actually entered is captured by the EXISTING
## CodeTracer compile-time-instrumentation plugin, `ct_instrument`, in the
## sibling `codetracer-native-recorder` repo — specifically its call-trace facet
## (`ct_instrument/calltrace/ct_calltrace_sink.c` + the `buildWithCalltrace` /
## `runWithCalltrace` build helpers in `ct_instrument/ct_calltrace.nim`). That
## facet uses the `-finstrument-functions` ABI (`__cyg_profile_func_enter`) and
## resolves each entered function via `dladdr(...).dli_sname` (PIE/ASLR-robust),
## de-duplicates, and appends each new name once to the file named by
## `CT_CALLTRACE_OUT`.
##
## reprobuild does NOT maintain its own `-finstrument-functions` runtime: the
## instrumentation belongs to the native recorder; reprobuild only CONSUMES the
## executed-function set. We invoke the plugin through the CodeTracer
## build-siblings strategy — `direnv exec <native-recorder-repo> <cmd>` — so the
## plugin builds and runs in ITS OWN Nix dev shell (which has the right clang/gcc
## + Nim), exactly as the M13 live-recorder drivers do for the other recorders.
##
## See:
##   * `codetracer-specs/Planned-Features/Nim-Parallel-Test-Framework.md` §16.7
##     — the executed-function set drives incremental test selection.
##   * MCR-Calltrace-Design §22d — the compile-time-instrumentation alternative.
##   * `codetracer-native-recorder/ct_instrument/src/ct_instrument/ct_calltrace.nim`
##     — the facet's build/run helpers and the output file format (one function
##     name per line, de-duplicated; Mach-O names carry a leading underscore).
##
## # What this module does
##
##   1. `instrumentAndRun` — drive the ct_instrument call-trace facet (in the
##      native-recorder dev shell) to compile+link a C source with the call-trace
##      sink, run it with `CT_CALLTRACE_OUT` pointing into a trace dir, and leave
##      the captured name log (`InstrumentOutFile`) + the produced binary
##      (`instrumented_prog`) there. (An ALREADY-built binary can be run directly
##      with `runInstrumented`.)
##   2. `readExecutedFunctionsInstrumented` — read the captured name log back as
##      the de-duplicated executed-function SET (`seq[ExecutedFunction]`).
##
## # The native `ExecutedFunction` convention (shared with native_trace.nim)
##
## Native dependencies key on (function NAME + owning BINARY), NOT on a source
## file + line: a native function's identity is its compiled instruction bytes
## (spec §16.7.1), located in the binary by symbol NAME and hashed by
## `native_hash.shallowHashNative`. So, exactly as `native_trace.nim` documents:
##
##   * `name`    = the executed function's name (leading Mach-O underscore
##                 stripped so it matches `native_hash`'s symbol table keys).
##   * `file`    = the owning BINARY path (NOT a source path) — the native
##                 `ShallowHasher` reads `dep.file` as the binary. This keeps the
##                 cache schema unchanged.
##   * `defLine` = 0 for native (no source line in instruction-byte identity).
##
## # Fail-safe invariant (carried over from Phase 1 / M5)
##
## ANY error — a compile/link failure, a missing or empty output log, a run that
## produced nothing, a missing native-recorder sibling — yields an `Err`. The
## engine turns that into a re-run, NEVER a silent skip. No proc here raises.
