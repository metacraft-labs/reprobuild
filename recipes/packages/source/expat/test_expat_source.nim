## Smoke test for the from-source ``expatSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the FOURTEENTH real production
## from-source recipe and the FIRST autotools-driven recipe. Prior
## thirteen recipes covered three of the five M9.I flag-injection
## channels (meson + make + cmake). expat's unique coverage angle vs
## the prior thirteen is the ``configureFlags:`` channel — the first
## place to exercise the M9.I per-channel partitioning property from
## the autotools ``./configure`` side. The cross-channel isolation
## pin below would surface a regression that leaks ``./configure``
## flags into the meson, cmake, or make channels (or vice versa).
##
## Coverage (10 check assertions across 8 tests):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``configureFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + cmake channels MUST be empty).
##   * SINGLE library artifact registration (M3) — ``libExpat``
##     tagged ``dakLibrary``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
