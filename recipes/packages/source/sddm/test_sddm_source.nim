## Smoke test for the from-source ``sddmSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the TWENTY-SECOND real
## production from-source recipe and the CLOSING recipe in the Plasma
## stack batch. sddm's unique coverage angle vs the prior twenty-one
## recipes is that it's the FIRST recipe to ship THREE artifacts
## (two executables + one library) from a single ``package`` macro.
## Every prior multi-artifact recipe shipped either TWO artifacts
## (wayland's two libs, pango's two libs, mutter / gnome-shell /
## kwin / plasma-workspace's library+executable pairs, gdm's two
## executables) or FOUR (glib2's four libs). A regression that
## collapsed the artifact-name partitioning at the three-artifact
## cardinality would surface here, and a regression that mis-tagged
## any of the three individual kind discriminants (exec vs lib) would
## surface too.
##
## Coverage (13 check assertions across 8 tests):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``cmakeFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + configure channels MUST be empty).
##   * THREE artifact registration (M3) — ``sddm`` + ``sddmGreeter``
##     tagged ``dakExecutable`` and ``libSddmCommon`` tagged
##     ``dakLibrary`` within the same package's artifact set.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
