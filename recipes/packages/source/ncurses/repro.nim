## Source-from-tarball ncurses recipe — the SIXTY-SECOND real
## from-source production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio.
## ncurses is THE canonical Unix terminal-UI library — every TTY
## application that paints a full-screen TUI (top, htop, less, vim,
## tmux, mc, ncdu, nethack) links against ``libncursesw.so`` and the
## entire terminfo database lives under ``/usr/share/terminfo/`` for
## ``$TERM``-aware terminal capability lookups.
##
## ## Why ncurses matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## ncurses is the foundation of every full-screen TTY application on
## the v1 desktop. Concrete consumers:
##
##   * procps ``top``, htop, btop, glances all link against
##     ``libncursesw.so`` for the interactive process-monitor TUI.
##   * less (sixtieth recipe) links against ``libncursesw.so`` for
##     terminfo lookups + the alternate-screen / cup / smkx grammar
##     that drives its redraw layer.
##   * vim (sixty-first recipe) links against ``libncursesw.so`` for
##     the TTY frontend (terminfo lookups + the alternate-screen /
##     cup / smkx grammar).
##   * tmux + GNU screen + dvtm link against ``libncursesw.so`` for
##     the multiplexed-terminal TUI.
##   * mc (midnight commander) + ncdu link against ``libncursesw.so``
##     for their file-manager / disk-usage TUIs.
##   * ``tic`` is the terminfo-compiler that reads ``terminfo.src``
##     text descriptions and emits the binary terminfo entries under
##     ``/usr/share/terminfo/<first-letter>/<TERM>``.
##   * ``infocmp`` is the terminfo-dump that prints the capabilities
##     of a given ``$TERM`` for debugging terminal-emulator
##     compatibility.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 6.5 .tar.gz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/ncurses/vendor/ncurses-6.5.tar.gz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The ftp.gnu.org release URL is
## recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 6.5 (current upstream stable)
##
## ncurses releases are cut on ftp.gnu.org under tags of the form
## ``ncurses-<X>.<Y>``. 6.5 is the current stable in the 6.x line as
## of mid-2026 — anything ``>=6.0`` covers the wide-character
## (``--enable-widec``) ABI every modern UTF-8 TUI uses, plus the
## split-tinfo ABI (``--with-termlib``) that lets terminfo-only consumers
## (less, vim's terminfo lookup path) link against ``libtinfow.so``
## without dragging in the full curses windowing surface.
##
## sha256 = 136d91bc269a9a5785e5f9e980bc76ab57428f604ce3e5a5a90cebc767971cc6
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``ncurses-6.5.tar.gz``,
##  3,688,489 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded in
##  ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into fetch + ``./configure`` + ``make``
## BuildActions; the per-artifact build body + install glue lands in
## M9.L; the recipe records the four artifacts via the ``library`` +
## ``executable`` blocks so the M9.K artifact registry already knows
## what shared objects + binaries to expect.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## ncurses's autotools build emits four load-bearing outputs from a
## single ``./configure`` + ``make`` invocation:
##
##   * ``libNcursesw`` — ``libncursesw.so`` the wide-character curses
##                       windowing library consumed by top + htop +
##                       vim + tmux + mc + ncdu + every full-screen
##                       TTY application.
##   * ``libTinfow``  — ``libtinfow.so`` the terminfo-only library
##                       split out via ``--with-termlib`` so terminfo-
##                       only consumers (less, vim's terminfo lookup
##                       path, gdb's terminal-capability probe) can
##                       link against terminfo without dragging in the
##                       full curses windowing surface.
##   * ``tic``        — ``/usr/bin/tic`` the terminfo-compiler that
##                       reads ``terminfo.src`` text descriptions and
##                       emits the binary terminfo entries under
##                       ``/usr/share/terminfo/<first-letter>/<TERM>``.
##   * ``infocmp``    — ``/usr/bin/infocmp`` the terminfo-dump that
##                       prints the capabilities of a given ``$TERM``
##                       for debugging terminal-emulator compatibility.
##
## The upstream SONAMEs ``ncursesw`` + ``tinfow`` are PascalCased to
## ``libNcursesw`` + ``libTinfow`` per the libCap / libExpat / libGlib2
## precedent of preserving the canonical ``lib`` prefix while
## PascalCasing the SONAME body. The trailing ``w`` (wide-character
## variant marker) is preserved verbatim since dropping it would
## collide with the non-widec ``libncurses.so`` ABI on systems that
## ship both. The binary names (``tic``, ``infocmp``) are already
## unambiguous and used bare.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flags are hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``--disable-static``  — skip the static archive (not used by
##                              the v1 desktop story; libs are
##                              dynamic).
##   * ``--with-shared``     — build the shared ``.so`` libraries
##                              (default is static-only without this
##                              flag; v1 desktop's runtime linker
##                              loads ncurses dynamically).
##   * ``--without-debug``   — skip the libncurses_g.a debug library
##                              build (heavy build-time + install-time
##                              cost, no consumer in v1).
##   * ``--without-ada``     — skip the Ada bindings (heavy GNAT
##                              toolchain dependency surface, not
##                              needed for the v1 desktop's C/C++
##                              consumers).
##   * ``--enable-widec``    — build the wide-character (``w``-suffixed)
##                              ABI; emits ``libncursesw.so`` instead
##                              of ``libncurses.so``. Every modern
##                              UTF-8 TUI links against the widec ABI.
##   * ``--with-termlib``    — split terminfo into a separate
##                              ``libtinfow.so`` so terminfo-only
##                              consumers (less, vim's terminfo lookup
##                              path, gdb's terminal-capability probe)
##                              can link against terminfo without
##                              dragging in the full curses windowing
##                              surface.

package ncursesSource:
  ## From-source GNU ncurses — sixty-second M9.H/I/K production
  ## recipe. THE canonical Unix terminal-UI library; every TTY

  ## tmux, mc, ncdu) links against ``libncursesw.so`` and consults the
  ## terminfo database under ``/usr/share/terminfo/`` via
  ## ``libtinfow.so``.
  ##
  ## Tier-2b c_cpp_autotools convention consumer: the convention layer
  ## reads the ``fetch:`` block (registered via ``registeredFetchSpec``)
  ## and the ``configureFlags:`` block (registered via
  ## ``registeredBuildFlags`` on the ``"configure"`` channel) and
  ## lowers them into fetch + configure BuildActions wired with the
  ## right URL + hash + flags. Two-library + two-executable artifact
  ## recipe.

  versions:
    ## Pinned upstream tag. ``sourceUrl`` records the canonical
    ## ftp.gnu.org release tarball URL so a future maintainer running
    ## ``repro update-source`` can re-fetch from upstream; the live
    ## ``fetch:`` block below points at the vendored copy for
    ## deterministic offline test reproduction.

    ## autoconf generates the upstream ``configure`` script when the

    ## release tarball pre-generates ``configure`` but the convention's
    ## fallback re-runs ``autoconf`` if the script is missing.
    "autoconf"
    ## automake provides the ``Makefile.in`` templates the release
    ## tarball pre-generates.
    "automake"
    ## libtool provides the ``./libtool`` shim the autotools build
    ## drives for ``--with-shared`` to honour the shared-only build
    ## semantics correctly.
    "libtool"
    ## make is the build-system driver — the c_cpp_autotools convention's

    ## sentinel lives at the tail so any override (e.g. a future
    ## merged-ABI variant) can append ``--without-termlib`` later
    ## without re-ordering this block.
    ##
    ## ``--disable-static`` skips the static archive.
