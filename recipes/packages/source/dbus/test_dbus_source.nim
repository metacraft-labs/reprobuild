## Smoke test for the from-source ``dbusSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the FORTIETH real production
## from-source recipe. dbus's unique coverage angle vs the prior
## thirty-nine is being the FIRST from-source dbus daemon family
## recipe driven by autotools (sibling ``dbusBrokerSource`` covers the
## bus1 broker via meson + ninja). One executable (``dbusDaemon``) +
## one library (``libDbus1``) from a single ``./configure`` + ``make``
## invocation — exercising the executable + library mixed-kind shape
## on the autotools channel (util-linux precedent for the same shape
## at the eight-artifact cardinality).
##
## Coverage (≥8 tests with multiple assertions each):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``configureFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + cmake channels MUST be empty).
##   * TWO artifact registration (M3) — ``dbusDaemon`` tagged
##     ``dakExecutable`` + ``libDbus1`` tagged ``dakLibrary``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
